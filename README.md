# Student-Gradebook-System
Schools and teachers need a way to keep track of students’ grades for different subjects, calculate their averages, and determine who passes or fails. This requires organizing students, subjects, and grades efficiently.

Features Required:
1. Add Students and Subjects
2. Record Grades for Each Student in Each Subject
3. Calculate Average Grade for Each Student
4. Determine if a Student Passed (e.g., average >= 50%)

Why OOP?
This problem is ideal for OOP because:

Encapsulation: Each student and subject can have their own data and behavior.
Inheritance: Different student types (e.g., undergraduate, graduate) can have different pass marks.
Polymorphism: The grade calculation or pass/fail logic can be customized.
Abstraction: The gradebook hides internal data structures and exposes useful methods.
